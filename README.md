# PomoFriends ‚è≥üìñüë•

## Project Description

### Background & Problem Statement

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method where a person sets a timer for a specified period ‚Äì traditionally 25 minutes ‚Äì and focuses on a single task during this timer. Once the 25 minutes are over, a 5-minute break occurs, and then the Pomodoro Technique repeats. Several studies have proven that the Pomodoro Technique helps increase productivity and encourages people to complete tasks without any distractions by having them focus on the task at hand.

Presently, numerous apps and web applications are available for the Pomodoro Technique. However, as we have found, many of them lack social features. Only a tiny handful of them allow the possibility of having groups, but even then, these applications do not have any social aspects like chat boxes or even group hosting. This is where PomoFriends comes in.

### Solution

PomoFriends is a new web application that aims to harbor a healthy and productive environment and encourage accountability amongst its users through social features that other Pomodoro apps do not have. By implementing aspects like messaging and task sharing in a productivity app, PomoFriends can help users be accountable, especially when done with others or in a group.

With our application, users can create groups, invite friends or peers, list their tasks, set their timers individually or as a group, and begin their timers. During breaks, users in a group can message each other, set up or edit existing tasks, and have the option to alter timers. On the other hand, during a ‚Äúfocus‚Äù session, users in a group will not be able to chat with one another but instead view others‚Äô current task and their remaining time. Disabling chat during this time removes a distraction, and accountability among group members is boosted by having timers and the focused task of others visible. Through these functions and more, PomoFriends can add another level of productivity by incorporating accountability with its users.

## Testing

### User Experience

During the testing phase of the project, a link to the web application will be distributed to peers to gather insight into their experience and any critiques or bugs found while using the app.

Our team will include a survey into the app to gather feedback from the users on their experience using it. Users will be able to report any bugs and other complications through this survey. This can be done as a prompt/pop-up that is shown to the user after their timer is completed and through a feedback window or link.
